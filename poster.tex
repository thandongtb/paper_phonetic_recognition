% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Phonetic recognition is an meaningful problem in the many fields of speech analysis. This applications can mention as  dialect identification [1], mispronunciation detection [2], spoken document retrieval [3] etc. Some main approaches to solving this problem are improve the feature selection on input speech [4], apply some deep learning techniques [5][6][7] or combination both of them [8]. With the sequence data as the phonetics, the architecture based on recurrent neural network is an appropriate approach [9]. It is more powerful when combined with the improvement of features selection in input data. In our approach, we combining the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) method with sequence-length for present the acoustic features of speech and using some RNN models to phonetic classification. All the experiments are implement on the Texas Instruments Massachusetts Institute of Technology (TIMIT) [10] phone recognition dataset. Especially, our data processing and features selention method give consistently better results with other researches when applied the same neural network model. Currently, we achieved the lowest error test rate - 15.24\% by using Bidirectional LSTM, which is currently the best result in TIMIT dataset and reduction of about 1.3\% over the last best result [5][6].

\section{Introduction}

In a general machine learning application, speech recognition technology is one of the most typical application recently. In speech recognition technology, given a sequence of acoustic observations, this technology decodes the corresponding sequence of words or phonemes. From that, we can use it for helping language learner in pronunciation. The typical neural network model is used for speech recognition system is recurrent neural network (RNN), an effective model in sequence-to-sequence problem.\\
In this paper, we introduce recurrent neural network model and some variants, along with some techniques to improve the accuracy for phonetic classification problem such as: sequence length, feature scaling, deep long-short-term memory (deep LSTM), bidirectional LSTM. With these techniques, the phonetic classification problem is greatly improved compared to the original model.\\
We evaluate the effectiveness of models using TIMIT dataset. The original data were converted to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features. MFCCs features were said to have better results in speech recognition problem. In each generated output of sequence, we use the results of previous and next steps by using bidirectional LSTM. In others, when applying feature scaling for input data, the training process will be more faster, and it gets better results. We get achieved 13.5\% PER, the best result in TIMIT dataset until now.

\section{Related works}

\subsection{Baseline}

A simple approach to solve this problem is using phoneme-based recognition and identifying pronunciation errors in the input speech of non-native speakers. But in actually, the accuracy for detection words is much higher than phonetic detection even for native speakers. It also mean that we can not directly apply  \textbf{Automatic Speech Recognition} system for mispronunciation detection. Instead we add to the ASR system a pronunciation model with possible faulty pronunciation variations are used to recognize the most likely phone sequences when it knew previous phones. Finally, the mispronunciation detection system is worked by executing the forced-alignment of ASR with extended pronunciation recognizer based on possible phonetic confusions. The figure below is a simulation of workflow in this system:

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{baseline.jpg}
\centering
\caption{\textit{ASR-based system to detect and diagnose L2 learners mispronunciation}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
As discussed above, phone-level mispronunciation detection can detect mispronunciations in units of phones, words or sentences. Firstly, the speaker's speech samples are first converted to certain types of features such as Linear predictive cepstral coefficients (\textbf{LPCC}), Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (\textbf{MFCC}), Power spectral analysis (\textbf{FFT}) or Mel scale cepstral analysis (\textbf{MEL}) etc. These features are used as the input of classifier. These allow the system to classify the mispronunciation by types. In our works, we have used 26 \textbf{MFCC} features as input features.

\subsection{Dataset}

In our works for phonetic classification and detection, we used the dataset named \textbf{Japanese Phonetic Database - JPD} [1]. The JPD provides IPA phonetic transcriptions that accurately indicate how Japanese names and words are pronounced in actual speechs, as well as accent codes, for each entry. It includes detail descriptions of 130,000 entries in Japanese.

The advantage of this dataset are: it includes the pitch accent position for each phonetic and it is so meaningful for many speech processing tasks. An example of phonetics collection in \textbf{JPD} is shown below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{dataset.png}
\centering
\caption{\textit{JPD phonetics dataset with pitch accent}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phonetic classification methods}

Deep learning is a technique used a lot recently. There are  several methods of deep learning that we use there. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed graph along a sequence. This allows exhibitting dynamic temporal behavior for a time sequence. We use RNN with 3 layers of LSTM cell. Another deep neural network class we use there is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it also find the connectivity between features and help us to improve the accuracy. The architecture of CNN we use there is combination of convolutional layers, maxpool and fully connected layers. Finally we use both RNN and CNN in a combination called deepspeech, they help us increasing the accuracy in this works.

\subsection{Result}

We tried some models of deep learning architecture mentioned above to training the extended pronunciation recognizer. Following our previous works, two metrics false acceptance rate \textbf{(FAR)} and false rejection rate \textbf{(FRR)} are used to measure the system performance. The comparison of our Neural Network accuracy with some algorithms is shown in \textit{\textbf{Table 1}}

\subsection{Long Short Term Memory}
In theory RNNs can make use of information in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice they are limited to looking back only a few steps. From that, LSTM cell have been designed to get around this problem. Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTMs) are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{\textit{Long Short Term Memory Cell}}
\end{figure}

\begin{align*}
     &i_t = \sigma (W_{xi}x_t + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + W_{ci}c_{t-1} + b_i) \\
     &f_t = \sigma (W_{xf}x_t + W_{hf}h_{t-1} + W_{cf}c_{t-1} + b_f) \\
     &c_t = f_tc_{t-1} + i_t tanh(W_{xc}x_t + W_{hc}h_{t-1} + b_c) \\
     &o_t = \sigma (W_{xo}x_t + W_{ho}h_{t-1} + W_{co}c_{t-1} + b_o) \\
     &h_t = o_t tanh(c_t)
\end{align*} 

where $\sigma$ is the logistic sigmoid function, and $i$, $f$, $o$ and $c$ are respectively the \textit{input gate}, \textit{forget gate}, \textit{output gate} and \textit{cell memory} vectors.

\subsection{Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks}
Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs) are based on the idea that the output at time t may not only depend on the previous elements in the sequence, but also future elements. Bidirectional RNNs are quite simple. They are just two RNNs stacked on top of each other. The output is then computed based on the hidden state of both RNNs.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

%As illustrated in Figure 5, a BRNN computes the forward hidden sequence h, the backward hidden sequence hand the output sequence y by iterating the backward layer from t = T to 1, the forward layer from t = 1 to T and then updating the output layer


\subsection{Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks}
Deep (Bidirectional) RNNs are similar to Bidirectional RNNs, only that we now have multiple layers per time step. In practice this gives us a higher learning capacity (but we also need a lot of training data).

\subsection{Other techniques}
\subsubsection{Sequence length}

In this paper, we use the input sequence is a 2D array representing each utterance of the sentence. Where each row is a feature vector with 26 MFCC values. Number of columns is the number of feature vectors of the sentence which have the longest MFCC features, called "max length". If the sentence has the number of features less than "max length", vectors with a value of 0 will be added to fit with "max length". This will allow us to use Tensorflow in training. Also, with the use of sequence length, we will ignore the dependence between sentences when we connect the sentences together, obviously for greater efficiency because sentences completely independent.
\subsubsection{Feature Scaling}
Feature scaling is a method used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization/standardization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step. By using feature scaling with input data before training, we get the better results and faster training. The technique we used there is standardization, first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. In others, standardization is much less affected by outliers.
\begin{equation}
	x' = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}
\end{equation}
Where ${\displaystyle x}$ is the original feature vector, ${\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}$ is the mean of that feature vector, and ${\displaystyle \sigma }$ is its standard deviation.

\section{Experiments}
Phoneme recognition experiments were performed on the TIMIT corpus. TIMIT contains a total of 6300 sentences, 10 sentences spoken by each of 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States.



\section{Conclusion and future works}
We have used the combination of deep, bidirectional Long Short-term Memory RNNs with end-to-end training gives state-of-the-art results in phoneme recognition on the TIMIT database. An our plan is extend the system to large vocabulary speech recognition. Another plan would be use some another techniques in deep learning such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), gated recurrent unit in RNNs to improve the accuracy.
